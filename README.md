# Inverted Pyramid Pattern Generator

This JavaScript code generates an inverted pyramid pattern using the `#` character. The pyramid's height is defined by the `count` variable, and the code produces a pattern with increasing rows of `#` characters.

## How the Code Works

### 1. **Variables:**
- `character`: The character used to generate the pyramid. In this case, it is the hash symbol `#`.
- `count`: The number of rows in the pyramid.
- `rows`: An array used to store the rows of the pyramid.
- `inverted`: A boolean variable that controls the direction of the pyramid's construction (inverted or not).

### 2. **Pad Function:**
The `padRow` function constructs a single row of the pyramid, aligning the `#` characters in the center by padding with spaces on both sides.

```javascript
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
}
3. Pattern Construction:
The loop runs from 1 to count and constructs each row by calling padRow.
Depending on the value of inverted, the rows are either added to the start (unshift()) or end (push()) of the rows array, creating the inverted pyramid effect.
4. Result Generation:
The final result is generated by concatenating each row with a newline character \n.
javascript
Copy code
let result = "";
for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + row + "\n";
}
Example Output
For count = 5, the output will look like this:

Modifying the Pattern
You can modify the following values to adjust the pyramid:

character: Change this value to any character you want to use in the pyramid.
count: This controls the number of rows in the pyramid. Increasing the count will make the pyramid larger.
How to Run
Copy the code into a JavaScript file (e.g., pyramid.js).

Run it using a JavaScript environment such as Node.js:

bash
Copy code
node pyramid.js
Conclusion
This simple script demonstrates how to manipulate strings and arrays to create a visual pattern in the console. By adjusting the count and character, you can easily customize the pyramid.
